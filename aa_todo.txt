=========== REDO LICHT ANALYSES?

GM fascicle elongation:
 7 str post L - big change at the beginning of trial (before zero)

 9 str post R - elongation outside the range of -10 to +30 mm?? pennation ~5 deg, length ~90+ mm... redo analysis?

10 str pre R - fascicle strain out of plot range? pennation 7-8, length 65+ (initial = 45) - redo analysis?

 8 con pre L - negative elongation throughout...?
11 con pre L - very big change near end of trial?
13 str pre L - fas lenght data must be erroraneous (0,4 mm)
21 con pre L - negative elongation throughout...?
25 con pre L - very big change at beginning of trial



ind MTU elongation:
SEE is negative and fas is more than total MTU?
9 str post R ------ see gm fas elong above
10 str pre R ------ see gm fas elong above



=========== re-run due to EMG:
16 pre con R
3 str pre r
